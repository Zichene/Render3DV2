# Render3DV2
Very basic 3D Rendering Engine. Made for fun using Java. Currently supports the import of basic .obj files (only if all the faces are triangles). Camera is movable but not completely controllable yet. The rendering uses rasterization and perpective projection. Main resource used: https://www.scratchapixel.com/.
