# Render3DV2
Very basic 3D Rendering Engine. Made for fun using Java. Currently supports the import of some .obj files. Camera is movable but not completely controllable yet.

## Optimize lag and add higher dimensional shapes
The goal of this branch is to optimize the lag when rendering. Currently lag has been reduced (on avg. takes about 50-60 ms to render high polygon objects).
Support for high order polygons in .obj files has been added. Any dimension polygon is supported now.
